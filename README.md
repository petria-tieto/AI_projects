# AI_projects
Code projects to experiment with LLM API's

# Background
These experiments are inspired by the fabulous course by Edward Donner:

Any feedback is appreciated.

# Instructions for use
For the calling of API's, it is necessary to sign to a LLM service like OpenAI.
Set your access token to a local .env-file.

Instead of a paid LLM account you can create a local model with Llama and call that. 

requirements.txt is in the root at your disposal for creating a virtual python env. By the time this repo was created, the examples work with python 3.11.
to activate venv:
- python3.11 -m venv [your venv name]
- source [name]/bin/activate
- python3.11 -m pip install -r
